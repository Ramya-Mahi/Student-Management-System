## Problem Statement
Develop a simple command-line application to manage student records using python programming language. The application should allow users to perform basic operations, such as adding students, viewing student information, and listing all students. You need to create classes and methods to implement this functionality.
Requirements:

1. Create a Student class with the following attributes:<br>
Student ID (int)<br>
Name (String)<br>
Age (int)<br>
Grade (double)<br>

2. Create a StudentManagementSystem class to manage student records. This class should include the following methods:<br>
addStudent(Student student): Add a new student to the system.<br>
getStudent(int studentID): Retrieve and display the information of a student by their ID.<br>
listAllStudents(): List all students in the system with their ID, name, age, and grade.<br>
3. Implement a simple command-line interface to interact with the system. You should provide options to:<br>
Add a new student (prompt for ID, name, age, and grade).<br>
View a student's information by entering their ID.<br>
List all students.<br>
Exit the application.<br>
3. Constraints:<br>
Each student's ID is unique, and there can be multiple students with the same name.<br>
Age should be a positive integer.<br>
Grade should be a double between 0.0 and 4.0.<br>
